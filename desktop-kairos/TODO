Use cases:

- labs (e.g. for students)
- kiosks (e.g. for shared public devices that need to be kept updated and safe)
- automotive UIs (media players and such) where upgrades should be made atomic

TODO:

- auto-login default user
- make /home/kairos rw but volatile (so nothing persists reboots) - already true?
- Try kiosk mode: https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/cage/
  e.g. with this: https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/building

  ```
  GDK_BACKEND=wayland cage -d /home/dimitris/workspace/wails-test/demo/build/bin/demo
  ```
