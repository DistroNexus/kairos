Use cases:

- labs (e.g. for students)
- kiosks (e.g. for shared public devices that need to be kept updated and safe)
- automotive UIs (media players and such) where upgrades should be made atomic

TODO:

- auto-login default user
- make /home/kairos rw but volatile (so nothing persists reboots) - already true?
